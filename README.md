# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 - Python Solutions ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my Python repository containing my personal solutions for the [**Advent of Code 2024**](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about), an annual programming challenge designed to test your problem-solving and coding skills.

## Requirements

To run these solutions, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.8** or later installed on your system.

You can check your Python version with:
```bash
python --version
```

## How to run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yanisju/advent_of_code_2024
cd advent-of-code-2024
```

2. Prepare the inputs:
* Download the input file for the desired day from the Advent of Code website.
* Save the file as dayXX.txt (e.g., day01.txt, day02.txt) and place it in the inputs/ directory.

3. Execute the solutions using:
```bash
python main.py
```

By default, this will run the solution for the latest day. You can modify main.py to select a specific day by modifying Day to a specific day. (eg, Day01, Day02...)

## File Structure

* **main.py**: The entry point for running solutions.
* **days/**: Contains the solution for each day's challenge.
* **input/**: Input files for each challenge.
